    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These sausage balls are a real crowd pleaser, whether you serve them as a breakfast or brunch treat, a holiday party appetizer, or a game-day nibble. Savory sausage, store-bought biscuit mix, and sharp Cheddar cheese team up for a yummy savory flavor that can't be beaten! My family makes these every Christmas morning.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 pound ground pork sausage, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 cups biscuit baking mix</li>
        <li>12 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step-by-step instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine room temperature sausage, biscuit mix, and shredded Cheddar together in a large bowl; mix with your hands until well combined. The mixture may seem dry at first, but keep mixing until it comes together evenly.</li>
        <li>Roll mixture into about 30 walnut-sized balls; transfer to a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and sausage is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
